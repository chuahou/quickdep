Description: quick metapackage creator
 Quickdep creates a metapackage depending on a specified list of dependencies,
 allowing for installation of that metapackage to cleanly install—and later
 remove—these dependencies, preserving manual / auto installation marking. It
 should be useful for temporarily installing dependencies for compiling
 something from source, for example.
